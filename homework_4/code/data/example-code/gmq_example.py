This file contains sample code about how to use Gaussâ€“Hermite quadrature to compute a specific type of integral numerically.

The general form of this type of integral is:( see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Hermite_quadrature for more details)

F = int_{ -inf}^{+inf} e^{-x*x) f(x) dx,  (1)

in which we're calculating the integral of f(x) in the range ( -inf, +inf) weighted by e^(-x*x ).
Note that for f(x) being polynomial function, this integral is guaranteed to converge. But for some others convergence is not guaranteed.
